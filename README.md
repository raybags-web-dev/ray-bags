# Scrapper-api-0.1

This is a simple scrapper api that scapes, generates and save data into a data-base(mongodb).

## Base url:

The base url => [base_url](https://raybags.herokuapp.com/) .

```python
https://raybags.herokuapp.com/
```

This web scrapper bot is built on top of my Portfolio website. I intend to integrate couple more apis fpr different projects.

## Four endpoints are exposed here:

```bash
 POST [skynews BREAKING]:
https://raybags.herokuapp.com/scrapper/v1/savenews
#scrapes the site, generates breaking-news data, and saves to the database

 POST [skynews TRAVEL]
https://raybags.herokuapp.com/scrapper/v1/save-travelnews
#scrapes the site, generates travel-data, and saves to the database

GET [Fetches saved data from the database]:

#gets breaking-data.

GET [Fetches saved travel-data from the database]:
